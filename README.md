# From model to production

Simple images classification model using the Keras Sequential API.

The classification is run on batch at midmight. 

Jenkins pipeline is used to schedule a batch prediction with a Flask API endpoints.
If new images are found on the images folder, the model will predict the classes of the new found images. 

The classification result is save in csv file and push to Github. Below is the output of the classification.

If the model can not find new images, it will not save any result.<br>
* The output of batch classification if no new images are found.
